<p id="para"><span id="p1">Preparation</span> <br>
Rinse the poha in water till they soften. <br>
They should loose their crunchiness and when you break them between your finger, they should easily get crushed or mashed. <br>
Now add sugar, salt and turmeric powder to the poha and gently mix. <br>
Dry roast the peanuts in a heavy pan till they become crunchy. <br>
<span id="p1">Making Poha</span> <br>
Heat oil in the same pan. <br>
Crackle the mustard seeds first. <br>
Then add onions and saute them till they become translucent. <br>
Add curry leaves and green chilies. Saute for half a minute. <br>
Add the roasted peanuts and stir. <br>
Add the poha and stir. <br>
Cover and steam the poha for 2 minutes on a low flame. <br>
Switch off the fire and let the kanda poha remain covered for 1 to 2 minutes. <br>
Remove the lid and sprinkle some lemon juice, coriander leaves and grated coconut on poha. <br>
Give a gentle stir and serve kanda poha hot with tea.</p><br> <br>
