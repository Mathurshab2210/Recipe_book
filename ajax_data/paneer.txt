<p id="para">1. Prepare the following:<br>
Cube 1 heaped cup onions (to saute)<br>
Chop 1 cup tomatoes<br>
Cube 1 more onion (separate the layers)<br>
Cube half cup capsicum preferably the same size as of paneer<br>
Measure 2 cups cubed paneer (¾ inch, 230 to 250 grams)<br> <br>

2. To make kadai masala, add the following <br>ingredients to a grinder jar:<br>
2 tablespoons coriander seeds<br>
3 to 4 deseeded red chilies (kashmiri)<br>
¾ teaspoon fennel seeds<br>
2 green cardamoms<br>



3. Pulse all of them to make a coarse or fine powder to suit your liking. Kadai masala is usually ground to a coarse powder. In this recipe, even the coarse ground spices get cooked well in the gravy. So you won’t get a bite of the spices even if it is made to a slightly coarse powder. Set this aside.

9. Add another half tablespoon of oil to the pan and heat up on a high flame. To get the restaurant style smoky flavor, use the same pan used for sauteing onion tomatoes earlier. Add capsicum and onions, saute on a high flame just until half cooked (must remain crunchy). Constantly toss to prevent burning.<br>


10. Add paneer. Make sure it is not too moist before you add. Toss it in the hot pan for 60 to 90 seconds on a medium heat. Less than 2 mins. Do not overcook else the paneer turns hard. Transfer all these to a plate.<br>

15. Next saute well for 2 mins again. Since we have sauteed onions and tomatoes well in the earlier steps, we don’t need to cook the masala a lot.
