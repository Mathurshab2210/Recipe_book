<p id="para">Preparing potatoes <br>
1. The choice to peel your potatoes or not is totally up to you. Some may prefer the ease of leaving them unpeeled, in which case you must be sure to scrub your potatoes thoroughly before cutting. Peeling them will give them a more uniform look, but you will be losing some of the nutrients that the skin has to offer. Again, the choice is yours. I peel them. <br>

2. The next step is cutting the potatoes. For this it is best to use a large standard chef’s knife and a cutting board. You are going for fries that are about ¼ to ⅓ inch thick. The best way to approach this is to cut a long slice off of the potato so that it has a flat side that you can rest it on. <br>

3. From there, make vertical cuts of uniform thickness. Once the entire potato is cut, cut them lengthwise. Alternately, you can stack the slices and cut them vertically into long sticks. <br>

4. As soon as the fries are cut they must be put in a bowl and covered immediately in ice cold water. This will not only prevent them from turning grey, but will also draw some of the starch away from the surface of the potatoes. This is important because it will eliminate the chance of the fries sticking together when they cook. A minimum of 1 to 2 hours soak in the refrigerator is all they need. I also prefer to add some ice cubes to the pot. <br>

5. After that, simply drain the water and pour fresh ice cold water to the same bowl. We are rinsing the potato sticks here with the ice cold water. Drain to a colander. <br>

6. Wipe them with a clean kitchen cloth to remove any starch on the surface of the potato sticks. At this stage I also prefer to separate the long and short sticks so they can be fried in separate batches. This way they will fry uniformly. <br>

7. After that you will transfer them to a tray for quick drying, to minimize the splatters while frying. Do not let the fries sit too long, we need to fry the cold potato sticks. <br>

Oil blanch fries <br>
8. While your potatoes are drying you can proceed with getting your oil up to temperature for the next step which is oil blanching. A large, heavy bottomed pan/ pot or Dutch oven works well here. You can start by filling the pot about halfway with your oil and heat it gently to about 300 degrees F (148 to 150 degrees Celsius). If you do not have a deep fry thermometer, fry them on a medium hot oil. But for best results, I insist you use it so you fry it at right temperature. <br>

9. Once it has reached that point, you can begin blanching your fries, being careful not to crowd the pan/ pot.

10. After about 3 minutes you can remove them from the oil.
 <br>
drain the french fries
11. Drain them on to a wired rack or a perforated tray and allow them to cool completely. Continue on with frying the rest of the fries, draining them well afterwards and allowing them to cool completely before proceeding with the actual frying.

How to deep fry French Fries <br>
12. Once your fries have been oil blanched you can move forward with the deep frying process. You will use the same oil you used to oil blanch but start at a higher temperature. It is important to use a thermometer for this step, raising the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius).

13. Gently lower the fries into the oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan/ pot.

14. They will rise to the surface and begin to take on color in a few minutes. Once they are golden light brown you can carefully remove them from the oil and allow them to drain on a wired rack.

Shaker seasoning <br>
The finishing touch for your French fries can be as simple as a generous sprinkle of fine salt. Without a doubt, this is both classic and delicious. However, if you wish to take your French fries to the next level, give this shaker fries seasoning a try. <br>

It is a savory mix of garlic powder, onion powder, dried basil, oregano, dried red chili flakes, paprika and black pepper. Sprinkle this generously onto your hot fries and enjoy a well-rounded flavor that really makes your French fries sing!

shaker seasoning for  <br>
Add the French fries to a large bowl and sprinkle the seasoning as much as you need. Toss them. Season each batch separately and serve them right away. Also note that the French fries will begin to lose their crispness as they sit any longer, especially after the seasoning. <br></p><br>
